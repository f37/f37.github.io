SeqMDN module
=============

This software toolbox took the theoretical background from **Mixture Density Networks** by Christopher M. Bishop, 1994.
Given a sequence of data. The model approximates the underlying density of the provided sequence given the observation
of a fixed amount of previous timesteps. The model is invariant of the dimensionality or modality of the data. Given
the first coordinate represents the 'time' or 'order' of the sequence. A Mixture Density Network has universal
approximation capabilities, thus we are also independent of correlation of the different dimensions. When the
density function :math:`p(t|x)`, prior to past events is approximated, the model is capable of drawing
autoregressive random variables from the density function and thus generating a sequence with a similar features as the
provided sequence we fed data from.
