====================================
Data Orchestration Toolbox (**DOT**)
====================================

This is a toolbox for orchestrating data, with a special focus on sequences. A possible Model to build from this
toolbox is a Mixture Density Network (MDN). Described in the corresponding paper by Christopher M. Bishop, 1994.
Together with embeddings provided in this library sequence modelling is possible, as well as data preparation for
prediction tasks.

This software toolbox lies upon the theoretical/mathematical background from **Mixture Density Networks** by
Christopher M. Bishop, 1994. The MDN will be used to predict future states of sequential data.

Introduction
============

Given a sequence of data. The model approximates the underlying density for following states. Prior to the observation
of a fixed amount of previous time steps this generative model is capable of autoregressively generate a sequence.
The toolbox tries to be invariant of the dimensionality or modality of the data. For convenience the toolbox asserts
the first coordinate of a tensor to be *time* or *order* of the sequence.

To accomplish that we will need a function approximator, the bayesian framework and tools to handle raw sequence data.

Machine Learning
================

For the described problem we need a software toolbox capable of preparing raw data in Machine Learning processable form.
When data is preprocessed we need a universal approximator in order to get a bayesian representation of the data. In
this case we took a Neural Network.

That will be found in: `Neurocat <Neurocat.html>`__

This python module consists of

- a **loading** class, that approximates the remaining computation time. It is necessary
  for the invariance of the data shape. A high dimensional data stream or a big frequency it will be good to know in practice
  if your computation unit needs an Hour or a week.
- methods for elegantly build and visualise Neural Network Layers in **tensorflow**. Graph pictures will be provided.

Bayesian Framework
==================

To describe the bayesian framework and for embedding the data in time I will introduce

Experiments
===========

To demonstrate the power of the Toolbox, I try to use as basic examples as possible to demonstrate the dimensions of
possibilities the toolbox can do.

Embeddings
----------

A huge contribution of this Frame work are a small collection of awesome embeddings, that need to get in larger focus.

- a method for a **time embedding**. A highlight in this documentation. Because time embedding is just a subpart of this
  method it's a dimension invariant processor that can slide through tensors in sub tensors and define the amount of steps
  and size of the subtensor (smaller then the tensor observed). One other application would be to stride through an
  image for getting its kernels for a CNN Network.
