# SnaKI

Getting the Google DeepMind Atari action into the snake game.
More Videos follow...

Basically this algorithm learns a strategy to succed in a Game without any prior domain knowledge. The Agent perceives its environment and gets rewards/punishments after each action. When starting the algorithm the agent makes random movements and slowly learns from its mistakes converging to perfect policy.

## DQN
Performs perfect on its environment, but needs very long for training calculation.
