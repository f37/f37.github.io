# Tensorboard

I want to show you how you plot graphs with tensorboard (important for the 
lossfunction or basic analysis of you model). However I don't want to bore 
you. So we will explore tensorflows possibility to create derivations for a 
mathematical formula.

Let's take the easiest example possible a tensor of rank zero. A scalar.

I'm optimistic that you know the derivation of $x ^{2} + 1$. You know the 
chain rule and the basic patterns of building a derivation. Python for 
example is unaware of this principle unfortunally.
Tensorflow knows the derivation of basic mathematical functions and can 
reconstruct the chain rule over the graph structure. Therefore derivations 
are an easy task for it.




### Advanced Features
#### Derivation
#### GPU contact
Image with and without, maybe time comparison.
#### Building neural net
#### Visual debugging
Give example.
