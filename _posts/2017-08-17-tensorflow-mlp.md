excerpt: "While showing how build a simple neural network with tensorflow I 
want to give the reader a playful handling with namescopes and show how to 
make sense of your weight evolution with histograms."

# Basic Neural Network
## Introduction


### Advanced Features
#### Derivation
#### GPU contact
Image with and without, maybe time comparison.
#### Building neural net
#### Visual debugging
Give example.

Always 
trying to find out why numpy isn't able to letting tensors flow without 
boundarys.

##Knoten Ã¼ber namen finden
## Advanced Namescoping
## Loops over namescopes, play around maybe create nice graph pattern 
    without use
## Save Restore
## Mystery Layer
## Partially connected layer
