title:  "Introduction to Tensorflow - 03 Basic Neural Network"
excerpt: "While showing how build to a simple neural network with tensorflow I 
want to give the reader a playful handling with namescopes and show how to 
make sense of your weight evolution with histograms."

# Basic Neural Network
## Introduction
I assume the reader to have a basic knowledge about neural networks. I will 
just explain how to build one with tensorflow. I will not explain what a 
neural network is.

### Advanced Features
#### Derivation
#### GPU contact
Image with and without, maybe time comparison.
#### Building neural net
#### Visual debugging
Give example.

Always 
trying to find out why numpy isn't able to letting tensors flow without 
boundarys.

##Knoten Ã¼ber namen finden
## Advanced Namescoping
## Loops over namescopes, play around maybe create nice graph pattern 
    without use
## Save Restore
## Mystery Layer
## Partially connected layer
