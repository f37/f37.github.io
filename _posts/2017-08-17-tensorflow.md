# Tensorflow 101

## tensorflow vs. numpy

### What is python?
> Python is a programming language that lets you **work quickly** and 
**integrate systems** more effectively. 
 **- python.org**
 
### What is numpy?
> NumPy is the fundamental **package** for scientific computing with Python. 
  **- numpy.org**

### What is tensorflow?
> An open-source software **library** for Machine Intelligence.
  **- tensorflow.org**

Explanation of the different of the programming approach.
We will skip variable initialization, loops, functions and library calls. I 
want to give the bridge what we are doing and how we are doing it. The tools
you have to find yourself. We have infinite possibilities thats why I never 
can cover the whole tensorflow, because of that it is important that you know 
the documentation and how to use it

BEISPIELANWENDUNG IMMER VON BENUTZUNG!

### similarities

#### arrays and tensors
We will begin with the basic tools you need. **Tensors/Arrays**.

We will create a numpy array of dimension 2 and a tensor of rank 2
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# create a matrix
npMatrix = np.zeros(shape=(3, 3), dtype=np.float32)
tfMatrix = tf.zeros(shape=(3, 3), dtype=tf.float32)

# print out results
print("Numpy Matrix:\n", npMatrix, "\n")
print("Tensorflow node:\n", tfMatrix, "\n")

# or maybe in the right way
with tf.Session() as sess:
    node = sess.run(tfMatrix)
    print("Tensorflow node value:\n", node, "\n")
```
Outputs:
```
Numpy Matrix:
 [[ 0.  0.  0.]
  [ 0.  0.  0.]
  [ 0.  0.  0.]] 
  
Tensorflow node:
 Tensor("zeros_1:0", shape=(3, 3), dtype=float32)
 
Tensorflow node value:
 [[ 0.  0.  0.]
  [ 0.  0.  0.]
  [ 0.  0.  0.]] 
```

# Notes
we still work in python, but we are using tensorflow (C++) library (schneller
als python) Python ist eher eine elegante multi-purpose language tensorflow 
ein hochspezialisiertes hochgeschwindigkeits modul f?r graph computation.


disadvantages tensorflow: schleifen "unm?glich" man will auf der GPU ebene
flown: beispiel SeqMDN training und inferenz (GPU/CPU)
